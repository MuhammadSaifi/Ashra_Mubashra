        He fell ill during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and he had only a daughter during this period. Saad said:

O Messenger of Allah. I have wealth and I only have one daughter to inherit from me.\n\n

Shall I give two thirds of my wealth as Sadaqah?" "No," replied the Prophet. "Then, (shall I give) a half?." asked Saaad and the Prophet again said no. "Then, (shall I give) a third? asked Saad. "Yes," said the Prophet. "The third is much. Indeed to leave your heirs well-off is better than that you should leave them dependent on and to beg from people.\n\n If you spend anything seeking to gain thereby the pleasure of Allah, you will be rewarded for it even if it is a morsel which you place in your wife mouth.
